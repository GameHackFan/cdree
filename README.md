# CDREE - Cadillacs and Dinosaurs Readjusted Editor (Arcade)
An editor for the game Cadillacs and Dinosaurs Readjusted (Arcade).
<br/><br/>

You can access the editor [here](https://gamehackfan.github.io/cdree/).
<br/><br/>

Version 0.1:
- Created the tool with a Level Editor, a Seed Randomizer, a Patch Manager and some other features.

See all changes made [here](https://github.com/GameHackFan/cdree/blob/main/changelog).
<br/><br/>

NOTE: The editor is pretty new, more unknown bugs might happen.
<br/><br/>

Known Bugs:
- Sometimes when an enemy dies, he keeps rotating forever in the air and might softlock the game (bug present in the original game).
- If you hit butcher and your partner at the same time, all players become immortal (bug present in the original game).
- Sometimes the game throws an exception and it crashes, I saw that happen only on 4th stage, have no clue how it happens and why, it might also happen on other stages (bug present in the original game).
- Players can grab enemies from far away and sometimes even when they are in the air (bug present in the original game).
- 2nd Form of Final Boss can be double or triple comboed by players, he dies without even moving (bug present in the original game).
- If you get an extra life in the score count screen at the end of a stage, your character doesn't cheer after defeating the boss and also stop moving, but it goes back to normal as soon as the next stage loads (bug present in the original game).
- Tyrog doesn't puke or spit fire if the player active flag is set to a value that makes the player immortal, Punch + Attack button does that, being knocked down also does that, throwing enemies too, several other situations (bug present in the original game).
- Gameplay demo is grabbing the new colors instead of the originals (Readjusted version bug).
- Slisaur subboss has his boomerang color bugged (CDREE bug).
- Bikers spawn with bugged pallete (CDREE bug).
- Sometimes the game throws an exception and it crashes when you grab the car in the 3rd stage, I know some of the reasons why it happens, I will see if I can fix it in the next verions (CDREE bug).
<br/><br/>


WHAT'S NEXT: Fix the few pallete bugs, add some more extra features, I don't know.
